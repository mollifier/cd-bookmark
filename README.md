## Usage


```
# 1st form
% cd-bookmark -a [BOOKMARK_ID]

# or
# 2nd form
% cd-bookmark [-c] BOOKMARK_ID

# or
# 3rd form
% cd-bookmark [-l]
```

In the 1st form, add current directory to bookmark with <var>BOOKMARK\_ID</var>.
<var>BOOKMARK\_ID</var> is used as a key in bookmark.

In the 2nd form, find directory by <var>BOOKMARK\_ID</var> and change directory to it. In this form, you can add relative path from bookmark real path at the end of BOOKMARK\_ID (see example below).

In the 3rd form, list current bookmark.

## Options
* `-a` <var>[BOOKMARK\_ID]</var>  add current directory to bookmark<br />
                                with no BOOKMARK\_ID, automatically use free ID number as BOOKMARK\_ID
* `-c` <var>BOOKMARK\_ID</var>   change directory which is identified by BOOKMARK\_ID
* `-d` <var>BOOKMARK\_ID</var>   delete directory which is identified by BOOKMARK\_ID
* `-l`                           list bookmark
* `-e`                           edit bookmark file
* `-p` <var>BOOKMARK\_ID</var>   display bookmark real path for BOOKMARK\_ID
* `-h`                           display this help and exit
